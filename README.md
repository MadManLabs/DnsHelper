# Unblock-Us
Utility application to quickly swap between DNS servers for [www.unblock-us.com](www.unblock-us.com).

__ This utility is in no way affiliated with the Unblock-Us service. It is a custom tool made by a happy customer. I simply wanted a little more functionality than their current tray tool offers.
